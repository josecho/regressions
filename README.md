- Linear-regression

Miles Per Gallon = m \* (Car horsepower) + b

ML with regressions.

Matrix A Shape (4,2)
Matrix B Shape (2,3)

(4,2) <----> (2,3) Inner shape value are the same. Elegible for matrix multiplication.

(4,2) x (2,3) = (4,3)

---

Slope of MSE with respect to B
Slope of MSE with respect to M

Apply matrix multiplication

Result:
Slope of MSE with respect to M and B

- Logistic-regression

Given a vehicle's weight, horsepower, and engine displacement, will it PASS or NOT PASS a smog passedemissions check?

- Multinominal-logistic-regression.

Given the horsepower, weight and displacement of a vehicle, will it have high, medium, or low
fuel efficiency?
