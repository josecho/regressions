# regressions

ML with regressions.

Matrix A Shape (4,2)
Matrix B Shape (2,3)

(4,2) <----> (2,3) Inner shape value are the same. Elegible for matrix multiplication.

(4,2) x (2,3) = (4,3)

---

Slope of MSE with respect to B
Slope of MSE with respect to M

Apply matrix multiplication

Result:
Slope of MSE with respect to M and B
